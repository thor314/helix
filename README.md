# helix notes
Kakoune is a rethinking of Vim's concept model with a noun-verb or rather noun-verb model, rather than a verb-modifier-noun model. Helix is a Kak implementation in Rust, drawing on many of Kak's ideas for better ergonomics. The improvement in the new key-model is self evident. I think I'm most impressed by the flexible multiple-cursor patterns. The transition from Vim was straight forward, after a few tweaks.

This is my config.
